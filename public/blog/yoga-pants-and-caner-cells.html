<p>Today my neighbor told me she was going to yoga and I said yoga's not for me, it's too slow. Her response, " Oh I'd much rather run up and down a field chasing a black and white ball." hmm...</p>

<p>Every American soccer player gets to a point in their life where defending their sport is no longer enjoyable but exhausting. Some people just don't get it or don't want to. Besides you can dumb down anything using her formula-</p>

<p>Yoga- "Oh I'd much rather be in a flatulent filled room with a bunch of sweaty people.."</p>

<p>Riding a roller coaster- "Oh I'd much rather have my hair all messed up while someone potentially vomits on me.."</p>

<p>Curing Cancer- "Oh, I'd much rather stare in a tiny microscope all day, squinting at unregulated oncogenes.."</p>

<p>I don't particularly like playing American football or baseball, but I can certainly appreciate the mental chess match between a pitcher and batter top six with 2 outs and a runner on 3rd, or the beauty in execution needed to drive the football 80 yds downfield with 4 min left in the fourth quarter. And yes, even the meditative introspection yoga demands.
She got me thinking how I would describe soccer if it wasn't just running up and down a field chasing a ball.</p>

<p>For me, (when it's played the right way) it really is poetry in motion. It's all the instruments in a symphony playing to the same tune. It's a blank canvas for each artist to express their individual creativity. Every game is a chance to author a new book and no two stories are ever the same. It's an escape where literally, nothing else matters.</p>

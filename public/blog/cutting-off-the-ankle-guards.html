<p>When I was in college we had this Police Officer that would come to the gym the same time as us for weight training. Officer Packer was the real deal.</p>

<p>Every time we saw Packer doing squats, hang cleans, military press or even jumping on the box he was in full gear. That means boots, badge, gun, pants, flashlight, the whole lot. We knew him well so we knew why he did it, but whenever somebody asked him why he was in full gear, the response was always the same-</p>

<p>"When I'm out on the job I won't be in basketball shorts and a tank top, I'll be in full uniform. So, it makes sense to train that way."</p>

<p>When you're training keep everything as close to game day as possible. Whether it's wearing shinguards, LOUD communication, listening to your ipod when putting on your boots, a focused warm-up or the pre-game handshake with your outside back. 'Train with your shinguards' isn't just a literal translation, it's your state of mind.</p>

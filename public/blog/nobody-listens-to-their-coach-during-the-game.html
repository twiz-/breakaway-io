<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/19/adidas-micoach-elite-system-major-league-soccer/">Adidas miCoach Soccer Elite Real-Time Smart System</a> has become increasingly popular among soccer clubs to analyze and improve player performance. Basically, players wear chips that measure time, avg speed, max speed, distance, high-intensity distance, and number of sprints.</p>

<p>This is then streamed to the coaches, on the sideline in real-time.
Obviously, the thought of any one of the coaching staff looking down at an electronic device the whole game and then making "real-time" decisions based on these numbers is pretty sickening. But this raises a bigger issue for me.</p>

<p>Nobody ever really listens to their coach when they're on the field. You listen to the game. Sure, you have a general strategy communicated by the coach before the game, but part of the beauty in soccer is there aren't X's and O's for every imaginable scenario.</p>

<p>The game demands creativity and that is something you can't hear from your coach on the sideline and certainly something you can't gather from a data sheet. At least not from the data sheet miCoach provides...</p>

title: Parents and the american game
---
When trying to understand why the American game is so far behind other countries it can be useful to dissect all facets of the game/culture beyond the actual 90 min.

Recently, it's become clear that American youth soccer coaches spend a significant amount of their time, attention and energy appeasing the parents of their players. "Why didn't my kid play today? What were you thinking with that lineup? We haven't won in 4 games why are we paying all this money?" and so on. 

I haven't thoroughly researched it, but I'm willing to bet most other successful footballing nations don't have this same issue.
The need to appease parents isn't there overseas and parents are less inclined to question a manager of their 13 yr old at AC Milan, because well, they're Milan.
